## Report

### Worgroup kick-off call

During the kickoff call, decision was made to focus
primarily on Unreal integration with Perforce. It helps tokeep the complex
question of Perforce integration simple and at the same time it solves
production needs of typical animation/VFX studio that needs to use
Unreal.

#### Assumptions

- Unreal is the end-point for most of the data - it is producing 
outputs in a form of renders, but it doesn't really modify asset
versions already produced somewhere else (like in Maya).

- Perforce Workspaces are pre-initialized on every Unreal artist
machine and render nodes.

- Perforce use management is left un-touched by AYON.

- State in time of the Unreal project can be considered as
"workfile" in AYON sense. With perforce, we could think of
change list as of workfile version - Workfile tool then could serve as
a tool to manage change lists of Unreal project.

- Rendering on Deadline needs to work in conjuction with Perforce -
rendering on farm is done using change lists.

- Unreal Perforce integration suffice, there might help to create AYON
specific one in the future to help more junior artist (or those
unfamiliar with Perforce).

- P4V tool is still there for more advanced needs and for
fixing.

- There might be stuff coming out of Unreal, but it doesn't need to be
handled by Perforce (like cameras).

#### Work to be done on AYON side

**Tracking of versions**

We need to associate particular Perforce change list with all asset
versions loaded by AYON. Since containers defining loaded versions are
already part of the project as Unreal Assets, the information is
available inside the project itself, but that might not be sufficient
because to get that information you need to start Unreal Editor itself
and that can be time consuming.

AYON has a robust system of links that can be used for that: caveat is of the current usage is that those links are registered only during
publishing:

```
[ asset A v001 ] ----------,
                           v

[ asset B v004 ] --------> UNREAL PROJECT -> RENDER OUPTUT

                           ^
[ asset C [hero] ] --------'
```

*RENDER OUTPUT* will have associated links to `asset A`, `asset B` and
`asset C` only during the publishing phase where collector plugin
determines if they are actually used in the output or not (perhaps
they are hidden in the scene, or they exist only as assets but are
not instantiated as actors, etc.)

In this case, we need to register those links when change list is
submited because publishing isn't in any way associated with
submission to perforce in Unreal - that is done using Unreal Perforce
interface.

We might be able to hook directly into Unreal Editor logic and create/delete those links on the fly whenever asset is instantiated.

See [AYD-001](../decisions/AYD-001_Unreal_asset_version_tracking.md)

**Submission to Deadline**

AYON needs to be able to create render and publishing job on Deadline
using specified change list. Doing this from AYON has advantages like
ability to run validators before job is processed on farm taking
precious resources, etc. In case of perforce, validators would need to
do some integrity checks probably.

See [AYD-002](../decisions/AYD-002_Unreal_deadline_job_submission.md)

**External publishing to Unreal Project**

AYON can provide extractors to publish assets directly to Unreal project from other DCCs. There are several ways to do it:

**A** - Publish to temporary Unreal Project - publish FBX from Maya, create temporary UE project to "convert" that FBX to UAsset file. UAsset file can be then copied to the associated Unreal project

**B** - Publish directly to the associated Unreal project so the published asset will become part of the change list directly

See [AYD-003](../decisions/AYD-003_Publishing_to_Unreal_project.md)
