### Current state of Perforce integration effort

We began with a community pull request to the OpenPype repository ([https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4643](https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4643)). This introduces a new API layer for version control system backends and implements Perforce as one of these backends. We're abstracting methods:

  
```
get_server_version(path)
get_local_version(path)
get_version_info(path)
is_checkedout(path)
is_latest_version(path)
exists_on_server(path)
sync_latest_version(path)
sync_to_version(path, version)
add(path, comment="")
add_to_change_list(path, comment="")
checkout(path, comment="")
revert(path)
move(path, new_path, change_description=None)
checked_out_by(path, other_users_only=False)
get_existing_change_list(comment)
get_newest_file_in_folder(path, name_pattern=None, extensions=None)
get_files_in_folder_in_date_order(path, name_pattern=None, extensions=None)
submit_change_list(comment)
update_change_list_description(comment, new_comment)
get_change_list_description()
get_change_list_description_with_tags(description)
```

The primary problem with this PR is that it's using various Python and platform versions of the P4 Python API, which depends on the Python host. This makes it hard to manage. (As each version of Python in different DCC would mean to localize different version of Python Perforce library.)

To fix this, we've built a web server with a simple REST API. It acts as a bridge between the Python hosts (DCCs) and the Perforce Python API. Now, we only need one version that is binary compatible with the Python used in AYON.

We considered using RPC instead of REST. But it was too complex. Plus, there weren't any simple RPC Python frameworks with manageable dependencies to use - on the other hand `requests` module is accessible and usable almost everywhere. We might reconsider RPC in the future if there is a need and good candidate for the client/server in Python. There might be way to implement REST API to the server we plan to use for de-coupling AYON UI in Unreal Engine from the Unreal host process as is done here ([https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4075](https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4075))

There is a git branch implementing this - [https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/tree/feature/perforce\_unreal/openpype/modules/version\_control](https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/tree/feature/perforce_unreal/openpype/modules/version_control) - and it is still work in progress.

The integration phase during the publishing process has been enhanced to include the ability to add a workfile to a Perforce changelist and submit that changelist. It also ensures that the updated file is not already checked out by another user. It works somewhat similar to hero versions - versionless path to file is committed to Perforce.

## What we are working on:

We need a better user login system for Perforce using tickets. This method needs to be part of the framework itself. At present, we assume that users are logged in through the P4V tool.

We want to dynamically create temporary Workspace and check out only updated files. There are issues to be solved with submission when someone has those files already checked out.

Event-based system that will commit files that were checked out and therefore couldn't be updated. Whenever those files can be versioned up, we register an event and act on it. This can be achieved by sending an event to AYON with the file path to be committed into Perforce. At regular intervals, we can check if the file is still checked out and keep a temporary workspace until the files can be committed. To facilitate this, a user interface needs to be provided for the artist to view all files and their current state. We can utilize the ASH service to check these workspaces on the shared drive, allowing us to run the service centrally instead of relying on the local artist's AYON instance. However, we will need to determine how user authentication will work for this service to act on behalf of a Perforce user account, if necessary.

## Some questions:

Do we expect that artists have the P4V tool installed on their machines, and would their workspace be initialized outside the scope of AYON tools? If so, it will use permanent disk space allocated on the artist's machine. Otherwise, we could go with temporary workspaces. If published versioned stuff should be used outside AYON, it should point to the "native" pre-initialized workspace. Otherwise, committing and checking out could only be done in AYON. The big advantage of the AYON-only way would be versioning integrity - AYON will handle all version changes between its native versioning methods and Perforce one.
