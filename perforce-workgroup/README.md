## Workgroup Template

This is just example template of how decisions and reports should look like.
It is by no means imperative and can be tweaked to individual needs of every 
workgroup.

### Decisions

Decisions are in `decisions` folder as simple markdown files with some header
and the reasoning behind the decision. Every decisions must have separate markdown
file, named with tracking code starting with **AYD** (short for AYON Decision) and three digit padded numerical sequence such as **AYD-001**. For more info, use the decision file as a reference.

### Reports

Reports are in `reports` folder in files named `YY/MM/DD-report.md` format. Apart of the report
itself, it must have a date and the name of the reporter.

### Notes

Names can be `name <email@address>` or just names or even github users.
