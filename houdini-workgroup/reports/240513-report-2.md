## Report

On 2024/05/10 we had our second meeting.

### Meeting Agenda:

Discuss AYON Caching Node.

### Meeting digest:

Caching node:
- Where cache should live ?
- Local/farm/publish exiting files ?
- Generic types of cache ? (filecache nodes are using geometry ROPs only inside.)
- Leverage PDG similar to filecache and labsfilecache nodes
- Performance compared to regular filecache or labsfilecache nodes
- Publish on demand.
- Any necessary of validations ?
- Cache Versioning ?
- Should artist care about the cache path ? Note: They are able to find it through load menu.
- Batch Caching.
- Cache Pyblish Integration and possible network issues (some studios don't have optimized networking).
- Setting cache intermediate location.


Implementation Ideas: We can create 
- AYON filecache node
- Wrap the existing filecache nodes inside some AYON HDA
- Extend filecache node defintion and add AYON functionality
