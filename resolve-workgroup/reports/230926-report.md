## Report
Here are some points which were discussed during the kick off meeting. Order of the points are in preferential order.

### Generating master timeline from multiple timeline variants

To improve NLE editorial support, we can create abstract methods in the back-end that can be used by all integrated NLE supported DCCs. In the DCC project manager, we can select multiple timelines/sequences and use the action "Generate master timeline" to create a new timeline with shared clips in the longest durations. The original timelines should then be duplicated, and the shared clips should point to the new timeline. This is how it is done in Flame, and a similar approach can be achieved in Resolve.


### Generating intermediate files for reviewable representations

Similar to Nuke's Bake stream video, we can generate on-the-fly an intermediate video file in Resolve. This file can be then used as input for OIIO and FFMPEG transcoding. It can also have baked color grading look and display & view space.


### Colorspace workflow

We can distribute color grading in the same way Hiero does it with soft effects. Users can then load the LUTs to Nuke scripts as Viewer Process Nodes.


### Remote transcoding and publishing workflow

To minimize errors in publishing, it would be ideal to locally create a hierarchy, bake intermediate files, and then publish all products and their representations on the farm under the already created folders. Farm publishing can be done via Deadline python jobs.


### Action Points:
- Define priorities by negotiating with each studio, as different studios may have different angles on features.
- R&D the latest version of Resolve with integrated OTIO.
