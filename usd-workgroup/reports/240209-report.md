## Report

On 2024/02/09 we had our second meeting.

### Meeting Agenda:
- some concerns about async calls to server
- publishing UI improvements
- anything else ðŸ™‚

### Meeting digest:
- We discussed BigRoy's idea [written here](https://github.com/ynput/ayon-workgroups/issues/4), where an idea was put forward (to have a button in the publisher UI that shows an extended UI for USD publishing which will ease the development without editing the publisher code too much.)
- We discussed resolver caching ideas for achieving `resolver hints` or `shared cache`. we came up with different ideas
  - local cache (file on disk next to USD file that resolver can read from it)
  - Having `resolver hints` that are saved in a db. (`resolver hints` hold the most likely paths that can be related to a usd file)
  - Using [`memcached`](https://memcached.org/) which is a low level cache server that's shared among USD files (USD resolver can check it first before querying Ayon server)
  - Saving our cache as a flat list. 
  - Patch querying URI paths instead of doing multiple single queries. 
- How many USD Builds should we provide knowing that we have different python environments/DCCs environments? 

## Things that was done through out the week
- BigRoy implemented [usd look publishing](https://github.com/BigRoy/OpenPype/commit/7015ccfe8edefd703a89add1ea87f1a618b58d26)
