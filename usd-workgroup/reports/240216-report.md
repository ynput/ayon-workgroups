## Report

On 2024/02/16 we had our Third meeting.

### Meeting Agenda:
- Revise the current state
- Discuss USD Editor and USD workflows

### Meeting digest:
- Current state:
  - Ready for Houdini Linux
  - Houdini Windows in maybe week

- Future state: (I believe there are some things have already been done or in progress)
  - Asset Resolver
  - Build the resolver against different DCCs on different platforms.
  - Set environment variable for the cache file location (we can have a one big cache per task)
  - Start with a prototype and benchmark its performance
    > Note that some studios might not want to use the resolver, so we might add an extra plugin at the end of publishing to Swap un-resolved path.

- USD Editor
  - Standalone
  - In publisher (it can be the standalone run as a sub-process)

- USD workflows:
  - Publish as a contribution
  - Publish and override the whole asset

## Things that was done through out the week
- BigRoy showed us a demo of his USD asset contribution publishing implementation at colorbleed.
  - Publish model variant from Maya (where artists can work with Maya shapes as usual but publish them into a USD asset)
  - Publish looks from Houdini
- Lyon built USD resolver across windows/houdini-19.0-19.5
