## Some questions 

Q1: Can pipeline admins select between different available usd asset resolver ?

No they can't. So, Usually they'd register the one asset resolver for their production.
OpenAssetIO is trying to solve and will, when/if they provide AR and they'll be adopted by major software vendors.
